Here's the traditional good point-bad point round-the-room feedback from the <a href="http://software-carpentry.org/bootcamps/2013-05-oxford-dtc.html">Oxford boot camp </a> for UK doctoral training centre's, run by Jonathan Cooper, Mario Antonioletti and Shoaib Sufi, two weeks ago.

<p>
Observations during the running of the boot camp included,
</p>
<p>
Setup: 
</p>
<ul>
<li>Enthought updated the EPD release between writing the instructions and running the boot camp! So the setup script doesn't work any more.</li>
<li>There's an issue with pasting (<tt>%paste</tt>) in the new EPD ipython. Using <tt>%cpaste</tt> might work around this.</li>
<li>ipython tab completion also wasn't working on some machines; not sure why.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Logistics:
</p>
<ul>
<li>It would be nicer if the room had space to walk along at the back.</li>
<li>Some issues with eduroam (cross-University internet) access; not sure if resolved by shutting down unused machines.</li>
<li>Having the desktops was helpful for people who couldn't get their machines to work.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Git:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Mario's recap slides were helpful.</li>
<li>SSL certificate issues with Git and BitBucket on some machines - would be useful to have the solution handy (<tt>git config --global http.sslVerify 0</tt>).</li>
</ul>
<p>
Python:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Introduce ipython's <tt>var. help</tt> system in the notes.</li>
<li>Don't use backslash to continue lines!</li>
<li>Be more precise about <tt>is</tt> and <tt>is not</tt>.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Testing:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Lots of people had issues with setting the executable bit and shebang line correctly. Probably better to run with <tt>python dna.py</tt>.</li>
<li>We also found many more people getting left behind. Not sure where improvement is needed yet.</li>
</ul>
<p>
NumPy:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Did list comprehensions baffle people?</li>
<li>Much more time needed for the long exercise! But still think a larger exercise, that includes dealing with basic Python datatypes & functions, is valuable.</li>
</ul>
<p>
SQL:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Importing is quite hard to follow along with. Having a pre-canned database for anyone who gets too lost is really useful.</li>
<li>(This is a general issue with following parts that involve button clicks and dialogs.)</li>
</ul>
