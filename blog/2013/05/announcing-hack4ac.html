<p><a href="http://hack4ac.com/">Hack4ac</a> is a one-day hackathon in London, England, on July 6.  Its goals are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Demonstrate the value of the CC-BY licence within academia. We are interested in supporting innovations around and on top of the literature.</li>
  <li>Reach out to academics who are keen to learn or improve their programming skills to better their research. We're especially interested in academics who have never coded before.</li>
</ul>
<p>It looks like fun&mdash;if you're in the area and interested in getting involved, they'd be happy to have you there.</p>
